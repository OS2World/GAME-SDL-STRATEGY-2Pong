2Pong v1.0a

Notes:
~~~~~~
	- Rewrote from scratch.
	- Much faster, uses less resources, etc.
	- Windows support.
	- Network game should work ok.
	- Graphics are obviously placeholders (if you can do better, let me know - kirsh@softhome.net).
	- `Kickups` will return in the next release.
	- Added a few Powerup-thingies (faster ball, slower ball, split ball in two, etc). Should make it a bit more interesting.
	- A settings menu (including getting rid of the powerups) in the next release.
