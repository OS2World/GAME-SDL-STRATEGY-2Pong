2Pong: A pong clone with 2 balls.
Version 0.6

2Pong, as the name might indicate, is a pong clone. However, there is one visible 
difference from the regular pong - it is played with two balls instead of one. The 
game features three modes of play - the regular pong game, a time based mode 
against an unbeatable AI opponent, and a "2 vs 2" mode. 
Network support for "1 vs 1" games is also available.
Network support for "2 vs 2" games is planned.

The game is written in C, utilizing the SDL library.
Use 'make' to compile it.
The binary is distributed with the package. Use 'make install' to install it.
It is installed to /usr/local/bin by default. This can be changed in the Makefile.
